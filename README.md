# [cz_discogs_py: A package to collect data from the Discogs music database](https://test.pypi.org/project/cz-discogs-py/) 

Discogs is one of the largest online music databases, where music fans from around the world can connect by buying or selling music in different forms from vinyl records to CDs. The website contains information on latest music releases, whether it be albums, covers, or soundtracks. Users can explore this information and add music releases to their collection or their "wantlist".

This package contains several functions related to collecting data related to music releases from the Discogs website. There are specifically nine functions in total that create and authorize user credentials to obtain data, obtain data on music releases from the artists of their choosing, make summary statistics and a data visualization of the music data, create a readable data frame from the user wishlist based on listings in the Discogs marketplace, and combine both datasets to indicate whether the user has in the releases data one of the releases in their wishlist. For further details on features dependencies and usage, please go to the Discogs website.

The package folder contains the set of functions within the discogs_module module, a screenshot showing that the test functions ran successfully (as of 12/16/2022), and a vignette to show how the functions can be used.
